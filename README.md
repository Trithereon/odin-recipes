# odin-recipes
This project is meant to display my ability to create a basic HTML webpage.
I will demonstrate proper usage of links and images, while using a clean file structure.

Review notes after completing the project:
- Making six recipes instead of three was very time-consuming, but it felt like very good practice for writing these webpages while following a consistent style. The first recipe page served as a template for the others and greatly accelerated their development. 
- Used GIMP to crop all images to the same dimensions 600x600. This size was chosen because I wanted square images and the smallest dimension in my collection was 600 px, so I reduced all image dimensions to match the smallest one. It was very easy to manage all the image files at once in GIMP and editing took a few minutes only.
- Using short filenames and directory names was helpful.
- I only chose recipes that I love, which helped motivate me to be thorough with this project.
